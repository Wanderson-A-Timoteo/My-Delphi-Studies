RadCORE 3.3.0.0

Search and replace in files
Search and replace in files
------------------------------------
I really enjoy using "GExperts" for this purpose.
https://blog.dummzeuch.de/experimental-geexperts-version/

I believe "cnPack" does it too, but as it makes the Delphi IDE slower, I prefer "GExperts"
NotePad++ can also do this operation.

*** remembering that you have to search in "*.pas" and "*.dfm" (the delphi researcher does not have this feature)


SEARCH.. REPLACE..

NEW FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS

rc_AddCssClass / rc_RemoveCssClass: Improved error prevention.

rc_RenderControlsExecute: Improved error prevention and new functionality.

rc_BootStrapRenderExecute: Improved error prevention for "bsvideo:"

rc_DynamicAlignment: New features( center:parent x-mobile-y and center:parent y-mobile-x )



NEW ATTRIBUTES

COLLAPSE

Now adding the "collapsed" attribute, the block will start closed.
The arrows also changed the original meaning to give the more correct context.


MORE REACTIVE RESOURCES

You know that classic feature that when we access a record and we need to encode the state, color, icon, etc. of some button or any other object to get the user's attention?

Ex: Customer BLOCKED by payment, Sale in OPEN/CLOSED etc where we have a field with a value for Yes or No (Y or N), or Open and Closed (A or F).

Now, everything will be simpler!

- field-cls

- field-cls-ico

- field-ico
